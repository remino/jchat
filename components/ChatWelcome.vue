# JChat <small>v0.1</small>

Ever wanted to know how it is to go to be a foreigner in Japan, go to an
"international" party mixing foreigners and locals, and have a chat with
said locals? Or do you already know how it is and you miss the feeling
of having incipid conversations? Here's your chance!

Thanks to years of research in artificial intelligence, we bring you _JChat_,
the Japanese chat simulator, with a bot emulating a typical Japanese person at
an international party trying to practice their English on you. Your virtual
partner was modelled after a 42-year-old Japanese salaryman who never left Japan,
trying to hit on 25-year-old foreign girls.

Go ahead! Have a chat! Have a _JChat!_
